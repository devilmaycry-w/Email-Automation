### Contact Information

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Verification Process

### Step 1: Access Google Cloud Console
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project (the one with your Gmail API credentials)
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**

### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

#### Basic Information
- **App name**: `CodexCity - AI Email Automation`
- **User support email**: `realankrit@gmail.com`
- **App logo**: Upload your CodexCity logo (optional but recommended)
- **App domain**: `silly-paprenjak-c84f70.netlify.app`
- **Authorized domains**: Add `netlify.app` and your custom domain if you have one

#### App Information
- **Application homepage link**: `https://silly-paprenjak-c84f70.netlify.app`
- **Application privacy policy link**: `https://silly-paprenjak-c84f70.netlify.app/privacy-policy.html`
- **Application terms of service link**: `https://silly-paprenjak-c84f70.netlify.app/terms-of-service.html`

#### Developer Contact Information
- **Email addresses**: `codexcity.biz@gmail.com`

### Step 3: Configure Scopes
Add the following OAuth scopes:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile`

### Step 4: Add Test Users (if needed)
While in development/testing mode, add test user emails:
- Your own email address
- Any beta testers' email addresses

### Step 5: Submit for Verification

#### Required Information for Submission
1. **App Description**: 
   ```
   CodexCity is an AI-powered email automation platform that helps small businesses 
   automate their email responses. The application uses Gmail API to:
   
   - Read incoming emails for AI classification
   - Generate personalized automated responses based on user-defined templates
   - Send replies through the user's Gmail account
   - Provide analytics and insights on email processing
   
   The app processes email metadata and content solely for automation purposes 
   and does not store full email content permanently.
   ```

2. **Justification for Sensitive Scopes**:
   ```
   Gmail Modify Scope Justification:
   - Read access: Required to fetch incoming emails for AI classification
   - Send access: Required to send automated responses on behalf of the user
   - Modify access: Required to mark emails as read/processed and organize responses
   
   The application provides legitimate business email automation services and 
   requires these permissions to function as designed. All access is user-initiated 
   and clearly explained during the OAuth consent process.
   ```

3. **Video Demonstration**: Create a 2-3 minute video showing:
   - User signing up and connecting Gmail
   - Email classification and template setup
   - Automated response generation
   - Privacy controls and data management

### Step 6: Domain Verification
1. Go to **Google Search Console**
2. Add and verify your domain: `silly-paprenjak-c84f70.netlify.app`
3. Use HTML file upload or DNS verification method

### Step 7: Security Assessment (if required)
For sensitive scopes, Google may require a security assessment:
- Prepare documentation of your security practices
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (already done with Netlify)
- Document data handling and storage practices
- Provide information about access controls and encryption
